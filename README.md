# SoftwareEngineeringProject
A software engineering project  

This project was developed using Java. It involved basic database connectivity to a MySQL database; more specifically, the classicmodels database. Maven configuration was also done in this project.

There were 3 main objectives for this project:

1.Report those payments greater than $100,000.

2.Report the products that have not been 
sold.

3.Compute the profit generated by each product line, sorted by profit descending

Testing methods were also used. In general, the testing process involves testing the data against the classicmodels database.
